I love traditional Asian clothing and when I saw this site I was excited to get started buying from them. I ordered a black shirt with a golden bird on it as well as a green halter top with floral designs. Both arrived in good condition (though they smelled strongly of something like factory chemicals) and I was happy with both. I saw nothing wrong with my order. They also seemed honest in that they did not process another shirt that I ordered when the color I wanted was not in stock and sent me several emails to notify me.,5,0,0,united_states

I have never had a problem with ordering or speedy delivery!  My most recent shipment had a minor issue, however when i contacted them through the live chat option, i expected the usual indifferent approach to customer service i've experienced at other online stores.  Not Olivia at Mr Chewy!  within 2 minutes she resolved the issue with perfect customer service and a terrific, helpful attitude.  I'm done shopping around, these people care, and the prices are the best!  If you want to feel good about where your online dollars are spent, shop Mr Chewy!  Thank You!",4,0,0,united_kingdom
I would not use them again purely because in this day and age there is no excuse for not processing and sending an order out in just one or two days following the order instead of 14 days especially as there are so many other companies to choose from out there.

"Bifocals ordered.  Arrived fairly quickly (2 weeks).  Second day glasses fell apart.  Phoned company - no apology.  Did not want to accept responsibility or have returned for repair.  Eventually agreed.  Posted specs guaranteed delivery.  Company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery.  Took a further 2 weeks of constant emails / phone calls to chase.  Company repeatedly told me glasses had not arrived.  After 2 weeks, suddenly they were found!  So they were trying to fob me off. Glasses returned fixed.  No refund for postage.  No apology.  Glasses are cheap product.  Side pieces keep wobbling about.  Very unsure these will last very long.  Poor product / terrible attitude to customer service.  Avoid this company.",5,1,0,united_kingdom

I wear contact lenses, so I am less fussy about glasses as I only wear them late at night or in emergency. So I ordered one of their special deals, and for under £40 I received an absolutely PERFECT pair with high refractive lenses and scratch resistant coating. Their service puts high street opticians to shame!  Side by side there is nothing to choose between the £250 pair from the high street I recently got, and my £40 pair from glasses2you.

I am extremely disappointed to find out that ebuyer filters user ratings to create a more favourable impression of products. Many people have reported leaving justifiable negative reviews only to find that their reviews have not been published. It is extremely hard to find any products or individual reviews that have a rating of less than 4 stars. I believe customer reviews should not be filtered in this way and I have lost faith in ebuyer as a place for me to purchase. I will move my business to Amazon for all my purchases as at least then I can know the reviews are unfiltered.,5,0,0,denmark

I ordered a cocktail dress from MashiMaros and it is gorgeous. The sticthing and components of the dress are very high quality and had I still planned to get married on the beach I would have worn this dress. it looks similar to the vivienne westwood short gold label wedding dress. The dress is heavy bridal satin with boning in the bodice. That satin is very similar to a mari gourlay formal dress I own. It arrived in just under 4 weeks which is half the time it takes to get custom made apparel through alfred angelo or any other bridal company. I am going to get my bridesmaids dresses done through them. There are a few small things about the dress I don't like such as the side seam of the bodice does not meet with the seam of the skirt however is not noticable as the skirt is puffy and gathered.

Since November we have been receiving bills and debt collection letters for £195 at our office address but addressed to the Landlord.

"For years I had been buying expensive supplements from online websites, slowly watching my money disappearing on products which would not last more than a few weeks. It was disheartening. Then I found out about myprotein.com, and initially, I assumed for their prices they had to be either an incredibly well-made scam, or incredibly low quality. However, after hunting for reviews and opinions on them, I began to realise the truth - they were genuine! Now, I have been using them for years, and would not use anybody else - the quality of their products speak for themselves, and not only are the prices significant lower than the brand-name supplements, but they come in much larger quantities too! I adore this company, and feel that the only reason people can possibly be buying the more expensive brand-name products has to be either a magpie-like attraction to colourful labels, or that they simply have not yet been directed to myprotein.com. I know I am gushing on, and so may sound false, but if you have a bit of money spare, buy some creatine from myprotein.com AND from a more expensive online retailer, test them both out, and you will understand fully. Long live myprotein.com!!",5,0,0,denmark

"Absolutely the worst. Unless you consider ""fast"" 6 weeks +.. Also, the repair job was terrible. I had two arms replaced on a pair of Chanel frames. When the estimate came through about the repair they asked if I wanted new reading lenses put in. I chose the lenses and paid for the amount and was told they would be mailed out quickly. When I finally received them the two arms were attached differently and were ""floppy"" - cheap workmanship, AND there were NO lenses that I had paid for, and they charged me $30 shipping. The online chat person Arial was unhelpful and would not let me speak with a manager. A wholly AWFUL experience after waiting almost 7 weeks. I called AMEX and disputed the charge and they found in my favor, refunding the full amount. So, BUYER BEWARE. Go elsewhere.",5,1,0,united_states

alanhensononline67 Posts. Joined 1/2004Thumbs Up: 12I ordered 12 seats from them a few months back which cost a pretty penny. They said due to the amount I was spending I was a preferred customer. Which came to mean they preferred more money than less. I get a modified receipt about 2 months later that was for $1500 less than I paid them and my chairs show up 3 days later which did not have all my options on them. So after 5 emails and 20± unreturned phone calls it is apparent they are gong to do nothing to fix the chairs or refund the difference. My only recourse is to reverse the chargers.,5,1,0,germany

"This is not a company I would recommend to anyone after my visit yesterday.  My daughter has an IPhone 4 that had a broken screen, but everything else worked on the phone.  The company states that they make repairs in four hours or less.  We went by the office with about 15 minutes before the 4 hours were up, and they told us they needed 15 more minutes, that a sensor was not responding.  We told them great, we will go to the grocery store and return in about 15 minutes.  When we returned to the store, with groceries in our car, we were told that the phone wasn't ready yet.  We waited and waited and waited.  After around 20 minutes I asked the manager what was going on and he told me that they were still working on it.  After another 50 minutes, we are told that this sensor didn't recover, but it's not a big deal.  This sensor worked when we brought the phone in.  Over 5 hours after delivery, we get a still broken phone with no apologizes or offers to make it right.  When we get home, we realize that the phone no longer has the ability to connect with our wifi in all parts of the house, most importantly, my daughters bed room.  On a final note, I wish the manager showed  half the interest or concern about my daughters phone not working correctly as he did show towards his new Kiosk which was having technical difficulties which he spent the entire hour that we sat there working on it.

"I was VERY HESITANT about purchasing dog food online, but the PRICE  was what enticed me to try buying my dog food online. I have only ordered from PetFlow 1 time, but I am IMPRESSED in every single aspect!!!! From the time I Placed my order on PetFlow.com until the time the dog food arrived at my front door was 3 Days!!! The 50 Pound bag of dog food that I ordered arrived packaged very well in a sturdy cardboard shipping box & was not damaged in any way, (Which was one of my BIGGEST Concerns ordering dog food online.....that the food would arrive damaged). I am also impressed with the PRICE of the food that I bought. There are only a couple of  local stores here that carry the Brand food that I am buying for my dogs, & the Price that my LOCAL stores are charging for the food is more Expensive than buying it from PetFlow....& the BEST PART of it.......when I buy it from PetFlow, it gets delivered right to my front door & PetFlow also sells my brand dog food in a LARGER SIZE BAG than I can get at my local store, which works out even BETTER for me since I have 3 Siberian Huskies to feed. Like I said, I have only made 1 purchase from PetFlow, but  I am VERY HAPPY with how my 1st Purchase Experience from them worked out. They offer Good Quality  Dog Food Products at Good Prices & have Lightning FAST Shipping!! I only wish they offered Coupon Specials to their long-standing customers, or a percentage off of your total purchase to their long-standing customers, & not just to their NEW Customers. That doesn't seem right to me....offering discounts to NEW 1st Time Customers & not doing the same for their long-standing faithful customers. That is the ONLY Negative thing I have to say about Petflow.....the lack of discounts to their long-standing faithful customers. Other than that, I am VERY HAPPY with my 1st Purchase from PetFlow & I will be Back, as long as they keep their prices Lower than my local stores. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PetFlow!!

"I stupidly lost my first pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarers on holiday in Ibiza (after only four days of owning them). Needless to say I was absolutely gutted and annoyed at the fact I'd have to shell out another £120 to replace them. I decided to search the net to see if I could buy them any cheaper than the full price I had initially spent in-store. After doing a quick Google search, I stumbled across Sunglassesshop.com.

I was a bit dubious at first, but having read a few reviews and researching the site a little, I quickly realised I had nothing to worry about! I placed my order (using a 20% off discount code that I found on the Google sponsored ad) and bought a pair of black Ray-Ban Wayfarers for £80, plus free next day delivery!!

Instead, the seller decided NOT to notify me, and I had to waste 2 hours of my life in order to figure out they had decided to keep my book instead. After some back and forth phone calls, they magically ""found"" my book in their warehouse and forced me to pay $3.99 for my book they tried to fradulently take from me. Unfortunately since I am a college student and NEED the money, I had to pay to get the book back..or so I thought, in order to sell it to a reputable company like Amazon, like I SHOULD have done. Unfortunately, this company has decided to screw me again and not even send me back the book that I requested on August 6th. If my calendar is working correctly, that was 17 days ago that I have been waiting. At this point, I want my $3.99 back since I did NOT receive even my own book back.

Ordered my brother's Xmas present in Nov, which the website advised was out of stock, but would be available in Jan..(as he already knew what he was getting he said was happy to wait).

Then it turned out they hadn't refunded the shipping...So I spent probably the cost of this on phonecalls (was cut off twice while 'on hold' after battling through the lengthy & inaccurate voice recognition menu system). It took 5 attempts for what passes as 'customer service' to find my account, then 10 minutes on hold while they talked to a supervisor, before saying they couldn't refund my card, but would have to send out a cheque for £3.95...Gaaaaaaaaaaaaah.

The delivery system gives you a 2 hour slot (not absolutely guaranteed) in as little as 2 days time, which is a big step above most etailers.  Someone rang to do security checks as I'd only recently moved to the address, and as there were a couple of sticky times when I didn't want delivery (school runs) they assured me that I could just ring up when I got my times and change if they weren't convenient.  Great in theory, but in practise I got an email at 18.51 - their call centre closes at 19.00, and the SMS didn't arrive until several hours later.  So, as long as you can guarantee someone will be around (you get charged if they have to redeliver) then 5 stars, otherwise 4 and a bit.

"I've used DPD in the past and have had nothing but first class service. But how wrong can you be huh? I ordered goods on Friday afternoon expecting it today. I even got an email from my retailer confirming today's date. I usually get a text in the morning of delivery from DPD giving me a rough estimate within the hour of when my delivery was going to arrive. This was the feature that I thought DPD had over the rival courier companies. However entered my tracking number online I noticed that my delivery was in the York delivery depot to be delivered tomorrow. After contacting my retailer about this they informed that my delivery had in fact gone to the wrong depot and that it is out for delivery tomorrow. DPD couldn't even be bothered to inform me of their error. If I hadn't contacted the retailer, like a lemon I would have waited indoors all day for a delivery which was never going to materialise. I cannot fault the retailer and the after sales service which they provided was very useful. Just one final note. Unlike other courier companies, I discovered that I could only contact DPD via their email enquiry form. There is no contact number to talk to a real life human being. In future I will be thinking twice on which courier company I wish to use. Even if I have to pay that little bit more, the service has got to be better than the problems I've encountered from DPD today.",5,0,0,united_kingdom

The addition of Onnit 180 was PERFECT timing and I'll try using that product for a hangover (For science of course.) I'm trying to convert the rest of my IT team to Alpha Brain and New Mood. I just want to thank Onnit for the fine quality and ease of buying supplements for any occasion.

They just have what i'm looking for every-time i come to the site. While yes its true that some of their items are pricey, if you know how to look you'll find some very affordable items. Another thing i just love about this site is that measurements are included for the products, and the many pictures of the item in inquiry. Shipping is reasonable, and very good. I have purchased 5 times from them and have never had any problems. I probably mentioned by others pay attention to the measurements, I always double check because I want to be sure what I'm ordering fits me and will be comfortable. No lie, i was a bit cautious the first time i ordered from them, and also one of the items that I ordered wasn't available anymore, so they had to cancel, deducted it from my order, and since i originally had free express shipping nothing changed afterwards, its just as they say on their website. I am quite pleased by how they handle checkouts as well, its very secure and it makes me feel safe how my information is being handle. Another thing that always surprises me is how they neatly and professionally they package the items, it so secure. Kudos to them, I hope they can open more shops globally!!

I have ordered furniture from made.com previously and have had good experiences. All the furniture was described as easy to assemble and didn't involve much more than fixing legs or handles on- 30 mins to 1 hour at most. So when I had to order some drawers for my sons room I decided rather than use Ikea and waste a day assembling it all I would order from Made.   The lansdowne unit was described as easy to assemble. When it arrived it was totally flatpack with 10 pages of instructions. The parts were incorrectly labelled and some fixings were missing. Some of the drawers pieces had holes where it looked like someone else had tried to screw things into them. Maybe they had started to assemble it and gave up and returned it! If so I know how they felt. All in all it took about 6 hours. The unit looks fine now its assembled but I will not be buying from Made again until I know they are putting more accurate descriptions on the website. I emailed customer services and they sent the missing fixings but no explanation or apology over the other issues. They have lost a previously happy and loyal customer.,5,0,0,united_kingdom

"I ordered a bag of food, 1 jerky bone, a bully stick & a laser pointer (added this item at checkout). The package arrived 2 days later & I was excited that the shipping was so fast. This was a good sign for my new supplier. When I opened the box it only contained the food & the bully stick. The Bone & Laser Pointer were MIA. When I inquired I was told they were out of stock, so they removed them from the order. I did not receive any notification that they were removed, except that they were missing. After 2 days (the girls was out sick & they do not use out of office alerts to notify people) they finally placed the replacement order. Then they shipped it with standard shipping which took almost a week. Not only did they error, they did not correct it properly in my opinion.

"I ordered a brand new flash YN-560 from ebay, it was sealed and under warranty. When I got the flash I found out it was faulty, it wouldn't turn on most of the times even with brand new batteries. Just after three or four uses, I thought I should get it checked since it was under warranty. So I sent an email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to Mr. William Lin at their Hongkong office. After that I kept on sending them emails to inform me when they receive my package. I got a reply after about two months saying that they still haven't received my package. Then after waiting for almost 4 months I decided to contact Royal Mail (UK) to file a claim for lost parcel. Fortunately, I found William's skype ID from his email, added him and found him online. He then told me that he had received my parcel a few days ago and it was sent for repair. He also said that I would have to pay them 20 USD for sending the flash back to me. I paid it right away and got my flash back within a few days. When i opened the package I found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem. When i emailed William to send the diffuser back, he said he'll send one for ""free"" if i am willing to pay the shipping cost. I replied saying that it wasn't my fault since he forgot to put the diffuser in the box and I have already paid the shipping cost, since then I haven't gotten any reply from them. Take my advice, NEVER buy anything from yongnuo and don't even hope for good or even satisfactory customer service.",5,1,0,united_kingdom

From the pre-approval process to closing, our loan officer Josh tried his very best to keep us updated every step of the way.

This was our first home, so as you can imagine we had lots of questions and it was very comforting to know that an answer was just an email or phone call away. Most times our emails/phone calls were answered by the end of the business day and occasionally the next business day. We had a family member going through the home-buying process at the same time we were. Needless to say her experience was a nightmare compared to ours.

This was right before Thanksgiving, so I was not expecting to get the phone any time soon. The day after Thanksgiving I receive an email that the phone is repaired and being shipped back! They even shipped it directly to my daughter at college rather than returning it to our home address. The phone works as good as new, making my daughter very happy.

Don't book a food delivery with them - I did.  They operate 2 hour slots (allegedly).  Booked a delivery for a Sunday expecting a roast for Sunday lunch - delivery between 1pm and 3pm - at 5pm I got a call saying they couldn't make it (after being fobbed off on the phone & no lunch).  I was promised a delivery for the day after at 6pm .. they turned up at 6.50pm - substituted cheese and onion crisps with salt and vinegar - like they couldn't switch a brand name for their own! Very poor - even complained to their Head Office who were totally dismissive - so they lost my custom.  I'll stick to Sainsburys - never had a problem with them.,5,0,1,germany

It was more difficult because my travel time is the first week of the August, and most expensive season. I disappointed to many other web-sites because they requested me the additional fee for confirmation when I was to pay, and all the prices on web-sites were not the real price. Also cheap flights had too long duration time even though it has not so long flight distances. However, the sky-tours was different.

This past Christmas I also used Blurb to make small, softbound books for my children.  I wrote stories that they could illustrate.  They turned out great and the kids loved them!  Every once in awhile BookSmart gets a little ""glitchy"" - it's not a perfect program.  However, I can deal with a few quirks here and there because overall, the experience is wonderful and our books are fantastic.  I recommend Blurb to many people, and I am a die-hard fan!

I had booked a room that slept 5 people. At the time of booking it was just 2 adults and 1 child but it then changed to 3 adults and 1 child. I called customer service as a courtesy to add the 3rd adult. This would in no way change the type of room I had originally booked which slept 5 people. The customer service rep wanted to charge me more stating that when I booked the room I paid a lesser price then what the room currently went for. Why am I being charged like its a new reservation I'm simply adding a 3rd person to a room that sleeps 5? If we had been adding more people then the room slept then obviously I'd expect an up charge at the current rate to completely change the room. Not to mention that I had checked the rates just prior to calling and they were actually less than what I had originally paid. The rep continued to argue with me about the price so I had her cancel the reservation in which I have to wait for a refund. I had to re-book my reservation myself in which I ultimately paid less than when I originally booked but remember the rep was trying to charge me more. This is all around terrible customer service that instead of just assisting me and adding a name to the book she caused more of a headache. I will never use Bookit.com again and I will see that others know they will try to screw you over. Don't bother calling customer service instead do their job for them.,5,0,0,united_kingdom

I've never been one to wait, so ordering supplements was ordinarily out of the question for me, but I somehow found myself on the site and I haven't gotten my supplements from anywhere else since. Not only are the prices lower, the service is also great. I also like that I can check out reviews on most any supplement right there on the site. I still hate waiting, but Supplement Warehouse does a great job of keeping me from having to do that with their excellent shipping times. A couple of weeks ago I found myself in a supplement store at a mall with a buddy checking out prices, and I couldn't help but to laugh out loud at the ridiculous prices after seeing what I can pay at Supplement Warehouse.

"I purchased a Dovedale solid oak desk form the Swindon store in April this year. If you order from this company you will know that you are not permitted to inspect your goods on delivery. On inspection it was hard to miss the badly damaged door. I contacted OFL who promptly dispatched a repair man to refit a new door. Imagine my dismay when he asked me to inspect his handy work. The door that was previously perfectly fitted into the frame was now some 4mm proud of the frame on the hinge side. The so called carpenter said he was unable to fit it any other way due to the  pre existing screw holes. I contacted OFL who I now expected to pull out all the stops as i had been the recipient of two successive episodes of bad service from their company. Instead, a somewhat off had & not to sympathetic lady form customer service phoned me to say that OFL had reviewed my photographs & decided to offer me £35 compensation. I told them that £35 will not excuse bad workmanship or bad service & ask what my options were. I was told that I could return the desk for a refund & re order if I chose to. I pointed out that this option would leave me without a desk to work on until the replacement arrives.  I was told that was OFL procedure. At this point I had a serious sense of humour failure & hung up on the lady. In the end I went for a second repair to the door that was carried out perfectly. Why did the first carpenter not do the same?",5,0,1,united_states

I was very skeptical about it at first especially after I could not send the money directly using my debit card and they do not have a Paypal account which I think they should so people can be more at ease and to make it worse, I am located in the Islands of Cape Verde, est Africa.But anyway I sent the money transfer through my bank and was eager to get unlocked. But 1st I had to be very patient since it took a few days for the money to be cleared, then another 24 hours for them to get the response from Apple servers. I sent the money on Tuesday, it was recieved on Thursday and I received the e-mail telling me that I was unlocked on Saturday morning (a week-end, mind you). That's why I feel nothing but pure joy joy joy, because these folks are real and they take care of their customers. I was even so happy to know from the web designer, that the concept for the site was done in Cape Verde when he came here on vacation months ago. Well folks, there you have it. I trust them totally and I will do business with them again and will tell all my friends about them. Thank you again for this new found freedom for my Iphone.",5,1,1,united_kingdom

"I was extremely apprehensive when I heard about Supplement Warehouse. I mean, they couldn't POSSIBLY be as great as everyone says, right? There HAD to be a gimmick, right? But I gave them a try & waited. The result: super-fast shipping (very well-packaged), tons of freebies (not ""crap"" stuff, either) & AWESOME closeout deals (as good as they sounded!). A fluke, I thought... so I ordered again & actually found an item for slightly less on another site -- I got ZERO grief as they beat the price.
