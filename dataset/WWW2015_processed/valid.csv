The Burgundy may evolve to something really smooth given some time, but I guess that the ""New World's"" PN's will be ahead then still, and definately more fun along the way - so I'l probably stick to the latter",5,1,0,united_states
"I'm not a big fan of ""insurance"" but I did go for the Extended warranty. I suppose if it breaks down, the warranty will be a good value.  Our Installer was patient, waiting while we tried to work out phone arrangements with our provider.  Be sure to ask if you can get any upgrades or ""freebies.""  We did and got a better deal than the off-the-shelf offerings.  A bit shocking, though, to see that the total cost over the 3 year contract will be over $1700.  Be prepared to be offered ""upgrades"" that may add 50% to your bill. But since the built in cell allows us to cancel our other phone line, the overall cost will be much less than having the separate line.",5,0,0,united_kingdom

"Nespresso (coffee machines) have unfortunately chosen these clowns for their warranty repair pick up service!  First, I had to listen to their pick up man effing and jeffing for at least a minute as he could perform the simple operation of opening a plastic box.  He then took my coffee machine, ragging it around with no care as he tried to shove it in the box.  After (he) trapping my finger as I tried to help the imbecile close the box, I endured a further minute of his profanities.  2 weeks later, with no forewarning (this I blame Nespresso for), they attempted to redeliver on the 23rd of February.  They also slipped another card; they claimed had been for the day before through the door.  I know they had only attempted the delivery once as the one dated the 22nd, they had left the barcode tear off at the bottom of the card (they would normally scan this and take it away to prove their driver had attempted delivery).  This meant they had saved money by not having to attempt re-delivery the next day.  I tried to call, but their ""award winning call centre” phone line, said there ""was a fault"".  As it was out of their office hours, unlike the phone line was saying, I was unable to speak to a member of their team.  I went online; their website also said there was a fault.  The next day, I called.  I followed the automated system for collection.  It gave me the option of thu/fri/sat/mon for collection.  None of these days were possible due to work/commitments.  As the card said the item would be returned after 3 working days, I felt under pressure to commit to a collection date.  I went online to see if I could find an address for the local depot - nothing.  I found a number for their customer services - after 20 minutes queuing, I realised none of the call centre awards were for efficiency and gave up to continue with my day.  Later on, I found a list of depot addresses and phone numbers (from a complaints website, listed by a distressed customer).  I called them the next morning.  The man I spoke to said he could only look into this if I had my consignment number  (I find this hard to believe that a delivery company can't find you from an address) but fair enough, I thought I'd take number with me to work the next day.  I called next day with the number ""no, we're just a depot, we don't deal with collections, I'll put you through” I was put through to a lady, who said ""I'll put you through to customer services"".  Another 10 minutes on hold, during my break, I gave up.  It was now Friday so we went away for the weekend and have just returned.  I tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward ""please hang on while I transfer you to a member of our team...  sorry, our opening hours are Monday to...""  I then logged on to the website to try and sort.  This threw up the result 'your package has gone for re-delivery'.  I suspect it has been returned to Nespresso - DPD will no doubt charge for this and charge for Nespresso to re-deliver.  A shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts.  This is basic stuff.  Royal Mail leaves a card telling you where your package is and how to collect it.  I intend to call Nespresso on Monday and complain about this appalling company.  The person who gave them a 5 star rating; possibly severely mentally impaired or a DPD employee (or perhaps both)!  Seriously though, I have never felt so strongly before that I have felt it worth taking up my time to warn others of such poor service – BEWARE!!!",5,0,0,germany

"I have used B&H for thousands of dollars worth of purchases and am absolutely baffled by my recent experience with their used department.  I bought a used Nikon D600 with an 8+ rating.  When it arrived I went over it and noticed that the function button did not work.  Looking closer, I found that this was because the front plate had separated on the right side of the camera by about 4mm, and there was a crack in it!  Hardly what I would consider light cosmetic wear!  I spoke with Jake from customer service and he was probably the only reasonable person there.  We set up a couple of plans for what could be done about it.  He advised me to send a detailed description of the situation along with photographs, which took several hours of my time to do.  He then told me that the email was checked daily and that someone would be on it very quickly.  This is a big concern of mine because I need a D600 body for a wedding I have in only 10 days.  After 2 days, I call them and the grumpy guy who conveniently slurred his name tells me that I need to wait for the email to be replied to.  I tell him that my case is particularly time sensitive, as was specified in the email and to Jake, who works there.  After a bit of hesitation, he takes my information and places me on hold for about a minute.  During this time (he states) he looked over the case, read my entire detailed description, looked over the photos, and showed the photos to his boss, who in turn told me that he will not change the rating on the camera, and that I should just send it back.  I have now lost close to a week between ordering and shipping because I wanted to go with a company I trusted.  During this time I have been asked to do a bunch of footwork and have gotten nothing in return.  I'll just say to that: if I ran my photography company like the used department ran their customer service, I wouldn't be in business for long.  Word to the wise, don't buy a D600 camera body with an 8+ rating, because it's probably going to go right back on the website and not be described as something with a significant defect in a body that costs $1250.  If I worked for B&H, I would sort the jokers in used department out before they caused any more damage to their reputation because this is not the company I am used to working with!  On the plus side, the return seems to be going very smoothly now that I have decided on that option!",5,0,0,united_kingdom

Massage table bought as birthday present a month before the date needed as stock was running out. The wrong table was ordered in error which admittedly was our own fault.  The person the table was for was unaware that the table had been purchased untill the present was received and the person who bought the table had no idea at the time of purchase that the table would be unsuitable.  The staff were polite enough but adamant that they would not help in any way as we had not contacted them within 7 days (their refund period). We feel that this is fairly petty as the table was unused and in the exact same condition it was delivered in. We wanted to exchange for a more expensive table and would have therefore spent more money. The only reason the table was ordered early was because the colours were running out and the order mix up was an honest and unfortunate error. The table was still in demand at the time we requested exchange and they were taking pre orders on the website for when the stock came back in so there obviously would have been no issue to sell the table on.   I admitted that the table was ordered in error on our own part and that they didnt not have to help me but did feel as that was clear it would not have caused any inconvenience or monetary loss to the company that it was pretty poor that they would not help me. I would not purchase from this site again as a result which is a shame as i would have otherwise been glad to spend my money with them.,4,1,0,united_states

"The customer service of Expedia is terrible! If you run into problems they will not help you at all.  After 5 hours on the phone talking to 5 different people, all I got was the phone number for the airline's customer service people! I have traveled using Expedia several times before.  This was the 1st time I needed to use their 1-800 number. My flight was canceled due to weather.  I called their number to find a solution. The agent on the other end told me that they would cancel my ticket if I found another flight. I found another flight and called back.  After waiting on hold with the agent for 2 hours, I was told that, because of the inclement weather, I needed to call back the next day before noon. I double checked to make sure that this would not be too late to cancel, but was assured that it would be fine. However, the next morning when I called at 6 am, I was told that it was too late and that my original flight had been re scheduled. I was on the phone with the person for 1/2 an hour explaining things before my new flight took off and I had to hang up. Once I was back in cell service, I called the number again. This time I was told their system was down and that I would have to call them back in 2 hours.  When I called them back I was on the phone again for another 2 hours until I was finally told that at no time could they have canceled the flight and that I should have contacted the airline directly right away!  When I pointed out that I had talked to 4 other people and none of them communicated this to me, I was told that they were sincerely sorry and that the people would be dealt with, but that there was still nothing they could do for me! I will never use Expedia for another flight. With all of the options out there, you can do better than this site.",5,0,1,united_states

"I have had 2 genuine Roomba robot vacuum cleaners and been pleased with both, but they are expensive and only last a couple of years depending on use . I saw the Klarstein cleaner at about half the price of a Roomba offered by Hifi-Tower and the reviews looked good so I went for it. The service from Hifi-Tower was excellent with great emails and tracking information and quick delivery form Germany. The cleaner is an almost exact copy of the 1st generation Roomba, even the batteries are interchangeable!. Its programming is not as sophisticated it basically does a circle then bumps around the edge of the room before doing more circles but it works. The remote control is great and if anything better than the Roomba, the only downside is the self charging and docking bay. Basically forget it. It will usually not find its way back to the charger unless you place it within a foot or so. Even then it often will not charge fully. I could not get the timed cleaning function to work at all and in the end I have removed the docking unit and just plug the charger directly into the cleaner like the 1st gen Roomba. That said it cleans well and as long as you aren't fussed about having to plug it in to charge and manually set it cleaning, then it is a bargain.",5,0,0,france

"I have left Orange after 13 years as a customer.  I had been without a signal at home for over three weeks.  I had to use my  BT landline to contact them as I had no signal at home.  This increased my BT phone bill by over £25.  I have eventually had an acknowledgement of two emails from CEO's office whom I contacted after two weeks. I had so many promises broken by staff who were supposed to call me back, the signal was always OK at home until they joined with EE and T-mobile. The staff in India are an absolute joke and were rude, surly and hung up on me.  If I could have rated it lower than 1 star I would have done.

"I booked a suite at Suites on South Beach in Miami for two nights July 3rd & 4th 2013. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that they could not find our reservation. I gave them my confirmation from Hotelsclick.com and they said they would call us when they figured it out. We were fine with that because we were off to the beach. They called us about two hours later to tell us that it looked like when the site (hotelsclcik.com) had sent the booking the hotel had replied that they were full. The  site never contacted us in any form. The hotel said that fortunately they had a room at their sister hotel two blocks away. We accepted that room. The Suites on South Beach has a kitchenette with a full size refrigerator and a sink and microwave and utensils. We were booked into a suite (one room, not really a suite) with only a mini fridge in it. We brought food to cook for breakfast and snacks for late at night. We could not use this food. When The trip was over I received a receipt from the hotel for about $65 less per night for than the Suites on South Beach. I emailed customer service at hotelsclick.com and I also opened a dispute with Amex. Hotelclick.com responded that they wanted paperwork which I sent them. They replied about tone month later that since I was upgraded to a suite at the sister hotel they did not owe me any refund. They said the suite had a mini fridge and the original hotel we booked had only a mini fridge and a microwave. They said the hotel where we stayed had a microwave available for use if we went down to the main desk and asked for them to cook food for us. I replied again with my receipt copies, a picture from the website of the original hotel showing a full size refrigerator and actual room that was a kitchenette. I copied Amex with my dispute number. The next day Amex credited my account for the entire charge. Two days later I received a reply from hotelsclick.com that they would refund $29.50 to my credit card because our room did not have a microwave. I told them they did not need to credit my card because my credit card company already had. I told them I was disappointed that they couldn't meet their obligations and then couldn't even refund the difference between the price of the two hotels. I don't expect a reply since Amex has already credited the charge. Also, hotelsclick.com sent my reservation to somewhere called jumbo tours making it even harder to find the reservation. What would have happened if there was no room at the sister hotel and I was stuck in Miami on a holiday with no room?

The guy I spoke to told me he hadn't ""gotten around"" to doing them yet and that he'd been planning  on making them on Sunday to post on Monday, I didn't get an appology either. Stickers finally arrived on Wensday, If I'm paying for something like this and I'm charged first class recorded I sort of expect to not have to wait over a week for them to arrive because someone plainly just can't be bothered to pull his finger out any sooner, also making a profit off the postage charges is a cheap thing to do (postage was well under £2..the envelope didn't cost the rest I'm sure). Overall the stickers where pretty good, just a shame I had to wait so long to get them, I would have used you again but sadly after this sort of treatment I'll go elsewhere.",5,0,1,united_states

"I think Agoda is the real deal, prices are reasonable, but when traveling to other countries than the US, you MUST realize they charge per person and not per night which wasn't clear on Agoda's site. Ie, it states,"" max, 2 people can stay in this room.."" so you book it, tell it the number of nights, and voila, you pay and wait for the confirmation. I looked at the email confirmation, it stated one adult, but max 2 people can stay in this room, so I didn't think it was a problem, well, I even chose the ""2 person icon"" when purchasing the room because it gives you no option on how many person can stay in the room, other than you can pick max 1 or max 2, etc.. so naturally i picked 2. I didn't think anything of it when I received the confirmation and when I arrived in Kyoto, it was a nightmare, and even though the Japanese are excellent in customer service, the one thin you must know is they don't bend any rules. Long story short, we ended up cancelling the room as they tried to charge us triple the price of Agoada's site and we booked with another hotel. In the meantime, Agoda states they will refund the amount, and it's been 4 days, haven't seen the refund yet... I also didn't like the fact the reps were not native English speakers, either Indian, or Thai.

"Appalling customer service, I would not recommend using this company. They say the dispatch within 2 days but after 5 days I had to ring them. They had taken my order knowing they were having delays with dispatch but didn't tell me this. They claimed they ask to note things like birthdays but this is not signalled during the order process, its buried in the fine print somewhere. They offered no help to get me my present on time and were very rude to me on the telephone. Awful experience and a very disappointed birthday boy.",4,1,0,united_states

I have been a loyal one.com customer for many years with a few domains but I am actually considering leaving now. Basically I was cut off from all email services without any notification whatsoever! All I did was send 2 emails with 6 spam emails attached to SpamCop. Spamcop is a great service where they do actually act on unsolicited emails. These emails were delivered to my one.com inbox by the one.com email servers. When I eventually contacted the live support after several hours messing around they were pretty rude and tried to insist that I changed every single email password on every device I had. I totally refused to do this and subsequently told to calm down by the operator. Being patronised by a fairly un-technical support rep is not what you need or expect! They eventually reinstated me and told me to report spams to them which I tried doing and they came back with some very poor support. I ended up configuring my own server to report spams from one.com. This entire experience has been very frustrating indeed. To be fair I think one.com do an ok service for a good price but the support is definitely lacking. I would only recommend one.com to people who work in IT like myself and will not be requiring much if any customer support. Now to do some research to see if there is better out there for a similar price....  NAME,5,1,0,united_kingdom

"Having placed my order, and received an email confirming despatch four days later, the trouble really began.  There was a link in the email to track the parcel.  It said to wait 3-6 hours to track, so that Parcelforce could enter it on the system.  Three days later, still no tracking, so I call them.  No, apparently too early to do anything, and told to call back in two days.  I call back in two days.  Before I even speak staff hang up, but eventually I get through and manage to speak  to what I think was the world's rudest man.  He has no idea why I was asked to call back on Monday - tracking information can, he says. take several days to be available.  He had no explanation for why the email said the information wold be available in 3-6 hours, and I have been waiting over four days.  He then proceeded to insist that the 2-3 days it takes from despatch for delivery, should read 6 days at least.  He refused to acknowledge that the website says it takes up to 6 days for delivery (from order), and insisted this was from when it arrived in the UK - even though plainly it does not say this.  He repeatedly argued, shouted me down, spoke over me and told me if I could not understand the simple terms, perhaps a manager could explain it to me so perhaps I could understand.  He then told me I should have paid for an expedited service for delivery!  He refused to acknowledge that the six days has passed, and there is still no tracking.  He cannot say when a manager will call me, he can do nothing for me if I don't understand he said, and maybe a manager will call today, but maybe tomorrow, but they are very busy.

The staff were all fantastic - friendly, helpful and fun. The only let down was the food. We stayed all inclusive and ate at the restaurant for most meals. I read some great reviews beforehand that said the food was really good but when we got there we heard the hotel was under new management so potentially this is why the food was below the standard we expected. It was still decent and for the most part edible but it definitely could have been better. It was all very samey and the hot food was never more than lukewarm. The included drinks were great, really good variety.

I purchased a canon lens in the past few weeks at a price that was below what some people on ebay are paying for the same model second hand lens.  I did not receive the lens within the 8 day period I expected and began to worry that I would not receive it.  Simply Electronics has a customer contact system that I attempted to use and even though it is designed to allow you to insert a code and then call back when the waiting list is nearly exhausted.  The sytem did not work for me so I contacted Simply Electronics by email and would give them 10 out of 10 for their response.  I received my lens a few days later so please do not rely on the negative comments you may read.  I would be very happy to deal with them again.,5,0,0,united_kingdom

To satisfy my sister's request to make Bramble Cocktails - having tasted them at a posh Westbourne Grove Cocktail joint - during our stay cation in Devon... Mission Creme de Meur was launched. Special agent 'thedrinkshop.com' delivered - overnight - ready for her arrival. The delivery man may not have been Daniel Craig or Tom Cruise... but the Brambles were delicious shaken and stirred with colour co-ordinated straws. Picture of them on the last sunny day we are likely to have for a while - on request. They taste just as good in the rain. Will need to order a couple more bottles much sooner than expected! 1 for the London bar and 1 for the Devon bar... P.S. if you can arrange for Daniel Craig to drop them in (Olympic stylee) when I place the next order you could get a 6th 'gold' star. Thank you... over and out!,5,0,0,united_kingdom

"To be honest, I am very new to the supplement / workout arena. However, I believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time. I believe that as a newcomer I am not blinded by any bias. I can look at different companies and websites and compare them objectively. Although I am sure that people have had troubles and shortcomings with different sites and different companies for whatever reason, as a first-time buyer I do not have any of these prior ideas that taint my mind. Who knows, maybe in a couple weeks my view of this company might have changed for the worst, although I hope that is not the case. However, in comparing different sites and different companies, I believe that supplementwarehouse is the most upfront, direct, and truthful company when it comes down to pricing and their service towards making sure you get what you are looking for at the price you want it. The one thing that bothered me initially was that shipping to my particular residence was $15 and I believed this was absurd. Yet, what they claimed (and was true) was that the price that other sites/companies offer with free shipping or lower shipping costs was lower than the $15 shipping + price of the products on their site. Although I only compared the certain products I was buying, I bet this is true for a large variety of items on their site. Another thing that I really enjoyed was that they had these packages at checkout $11.99 or $15.99 or $17.99 which all offered different things. But the greatest thing was, if you bought this package you got a credit towards your shipping. Why not get all these free things when you have to pay the same amount for shipping anyways? Anyways, I am happy with this company and I hope that this transaction goes through smoothly so that I can continue to purchase from this company in the future.",5,0,0,united_states

"My order of dried animal food arrived slashed open INSIDE the parcel (no damage to mail bag), and it was not what I needed.   I contacted Pet Supermarket to ask what to do and how to replace the order with what I did need.   I stated it was urgent as my 19 year old cat must eat a special diet for kidney disease.  I got a standard email that I would get a response within 24 hours.  This was. followed up 30 hours later with a standard email saying they were sorry for delay and would revert. After 4 days of nothing I left my complaint on the facebook wall. This got action and I got a replacement parcel swiftly.  Thank goodness because Pet Supermarket then, after 5 days, responded to my complaint to tell me the date my original order was delivered (not at all what I asked them to do and no mention of the fact I had the wrong food or a damaged parcel).  I told them this and got yet another standard email that they would respond within 24 hrs, with a follow up email stating sorry for the delay.

"Booking on Viator is like playing Russian Roulette. You never know if you'll win fabulously or get that horrific bullet. Most of my experiences have either been incredibly fantastic or desperately awful. As you do not know who the provider of the tours are, there is no way to check reviews elsewhere to see if these tours are good or not, as many groups offer similar tours with similar itineraries. The ones that are really good are amazing! Great tours guides, great itineraries, etc. However, the really awful ones seem to falsely advertise the tour on Viator. Those are the tours where what they promise on Viator is not what actually happens on the tours. I wish Viator would screen tour companies more carefully before offering them to others. Or have some recourse for unhappy customers to get compensated. Viator should also always show review from the latest reviews to the oldest, instead of the ""best"" to the ""worst"" as I find is the default setting. By showing reviews that way, it is misleading to customers, making all the tours seem fantastic, when often some tours go downhill with time.",5,1,0,united_kingdom

I was informed that I could use the desk but that it would cost 40 euros to do so - paying extra to get a car within a reasonable timeframe! Anyway, the family were very upset at this point so I just said yes. Then I was informed about the compulsory bring back empty policy where I have no option but to pay for a full tank of fuel. This should be reflected in the price that is on the internet. You know the stupid thing - I did the same thing last year via holidayautos and must have blotted the whole experience out of my mind - please don't make the same mistake I did.

The day came and no flowers showed up so I sent them a message asking why(because their online service wasnt up for several days). When they finally got back to me they claimed the flowers were delivered when I knew they hadnt been. I asked again and they didnt respond for several days so I had to get up throughout the night until I saw they were up and had them call the florist they had delegated the delivery to. They said the flowers were never delivered and iflorist apologized and sent the flowers that day. At this point I thought it was over but then I found out they sent the wrong flowers. I am tired of fighting with them over this so I have stopped going after them but I felt the need to warn everyone especially about their attempts to lie to me about the product. I would never suggest this place to anyone or ever use it again. The only positive was when I did get in contact with an actual person they were very nice,5,1,0,united_states

"My husband and I decided to book a hotel a few days ago. I could tell that I was talking to a foreign call center.. I think India.During booking on phone, the lady said that If I needed to cancel my reservation to do so before July 3, 2012 (she meant Aug 3.. July 3 has obviously passed this was know the 3rd time I corrected her on the date) if I canceled before Aug3, there would be no penalty. Well, the next day my daughter caught a nasty bug.. so we decided to cancel our reservation. When I called to cancel, I got a man this time but seems from same out of country. He put me on hold and said that he was going to call the hotel. He came back on the phone, and said that the hotel was not answering and to try and call back. He did say that the hotels policy is that they can cancel without penalty if the cancellation is due to a medical condition or something unforeseen.  So I thought well.. great! Well, I called back on Monday (today) to cancel, since he couldn't get a hold of the hotel manager yesterday. I told the lady that I had called a day prior to cancel, and explained the above to her. She put me on hold to call the hotel. She came back on after several minutes, and said that the hotel could not cancel because I would have had to call before July 3,2012. I corrected this lady too..WE ARE PASSED JULY 3... DO YOU MEAN AUG 3? She said .. oh sorry.. I mean Aug 3. I said, It's July 30th, not passed the 3rd yet. She said, yes I know.. but you needed to cancel before 7 days of your check in time.. I SAID..I AM CALLING 4 DAYS BEFORE NOT ON THE 8TH DAY! I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. I was told when I made my reservation that I would have to call and cancel before Aug 3 to avoid any penalties.. she said ""who told you that"" I said your call center told me that! I have it written down as I was being given the information! She said that the hotel could not cancel, and the the money already charged on my card is non refundable. I WAS FURIOUS!  I told the lady.. I am going to call the hotel myself.  I called the hotel, and I was friendly and courteous.. and I told the lady the situation.. that I needed to cancel due to my daughters illness, and she said that I would need to cancel through Expedia, and that the money was non refundable. I told her that NO WHERE ON THEIR WEBSITE OR EXPEDIA'S, OR THE PERSON TAKING MY RESERVATION TELL ME THERE WAS A NON REFUNDABLE FEE. I was told there would be no penalty, and especially since this was an unforeseen illness. She said that I would have to take it up with Expedia.  SO I thought to myself.. no .. I am going to take it up with my bank..stop the transaction. Luckily.. my bank is able to kick out the transaction as soon as it goes into ""processing"" THANK GOD! So now I am going to call Expedia back and make sure they cancel my reservation.. I don't even want to discuss money.. that is already resolved. They are not going to get one dime from me not ever.

They have changed! This is what happened: I am planning a vacation in the UK and I wanted to stay in London for 2 nights. I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights at Tune Hotel - Paddington. Later that day I found out Expedia over charged me by $229, plus, Expedia charged a $25 fee for each room each night. The Tune Hotel website charged less. So, I thought I would take advantage of the ""Best Price Guarantee"". I called them up and my booking matched all the criteria accept the Tune website did not covert British Pounds to US Dollars. They would not cancel my booking either. So, I'm out $229! Travelers beware! Expedia wants to rip you off! Never book a hotel with them without researching your choice thoroughly before hand!

I especially love amazon's product reviews, and it's links to show what other customers often eventually purchase after viewing a particular item, and I love the way amazon makes it easy to quickly find and read both glowing and critical reviews, to ferret out the real scoop on a particular item. Reviews are voted upon, so more detailed and fair-minded reviews are easy to find, and shoppers can fast become well-educated on just about anything and everything. Amazon is also great for internet window shopping!",5,1,0,united_kingdom

What was sent to me was the ""Greek Key"" design with Text SCRIPT engraving. Also, it stated that the locket was 1in by 1.25in but the width alone was barely .75in! It is very disappointing that I spent $90 to receive the wrong product. There is no excuse for this, as the site clearly states which locket is which and the catalogID on my order detail matches the one on the site for the ""decorative line border.""  I suppose it was foolish of me to even give this company my business after I read the reviews online, but I figured I would give them a chance. And when I emailed them about all of this, I didn't even get a response with an apology, let alone one that tried to make amends. Honestly, how hard is it to pay attention to detail? I'm thoroughly frustrated and disappointed in this company. The product is still acceptable enough to give as a gift - but to pay close to $100 and have almost every detail neglected, and for it to be on the wrong item entirely, and to not even get an apology?  I have lost all faith in this company. I gave them a shot in spite of what I read online, but they only proved those critics correct. Now I am unfortunately just ANOTHER critic.

This is the first time I have used Gak but I will be using them again I purchased a line 6 vx75hd HH radio mic system. Being a devoted shure and senheisser man I was a bit dubious with using a new and very different technology but the advise I got from gak was reassuring and I went ahead and purchased one as a trial. Well they were correct it works superbly infact so good that the bands that I work with along with some major British and American artists have asked to use them on future gigs. I used this for micing up brass instruments guitar cabs and even as overheads on the drum kits the selection of mic modelling is very precise.

Do not use the company - this is a freud. I ordered batteries which I did received but they didn't work at all. I tried to contact the seller but he was taking long to reply and kept apologizing and asking what was wrong. I contacted PayPal but they said the only way I would get my money back was to send the product back to the seller - which is in China. Till trying to resolve it with PayPal I had no clue that the batteries came from China as the website domain co.uk - suggests it's UK company. The seller said he would refund my money - BUT I NEVER GOT IT BACK. I kept contacting him for a month or more and each time he would say: Sorry I will refund your money. But I never got it back.
